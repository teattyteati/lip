# A simple imperative language

Implement a simple imperative language with the following abstract syntax:
```ocaml
type ide = string
  
type expr =
  | True
  | False
  | Var of string
  | Const of int     
  | Not of expr
  | And of expr * expr
  | Or of expr * expr
  | Add of expr * expr
  | Sub of expr * expr
  | Mul of expr * expr
  | Eq of expr * expr
  | Leq of expr * expr

type cmd =
  | Skip
  | Assign of string * expr
  | Seq of cmd * cmd
  | If of expr * cmd * cmd
  | While of expr * cmd
```

Use the following types to represent the values of expressions,
and the configurations of the small-step semantics:
```ocaml
type exprval = Bool of bool | Nat of int        (* value of an expression *)
type state = ide -> exprval                     (* state = map from identifiers to expression values *)
type conf = St of state | Cmd of cmd * state    (* configuration = state | (command,state) *)
```

## Concrete syntax

Refer to the [tests](test/while.ml) for the concrete syntax of the language. 
For instance, the Euclid algorithm for computing the GCD can be written as follows:
```pascal
a:=24;
b:=60;
while not a=b do (
     if not a<=b then a:=a-b
     else b:=b-a
);
gcd:=a
```
              
## Operational semantics

Define the semantics of expressions in a big-step style:
```ocaml
eval_expr : state -> expr -> exprval
```

Define the semantics of commands in a small-step style:
```ocaml
trace1 : conf -> conf
```

The function `trace1` can raise one of the following types of exceptions:
```ocaml
exception UnboundVar of string
exception NoRuleApplies
```
The exception `UnboundVar` is raised when trying to access a variable
which has not been initialized, as in the following command:
```
y := x+1
```
Instead, the exception `NoRuleApplies` is raised when the configuration
can no longer be reduced, i.e. it is already in state tagged `St`.

Finally, define a function:
```ocaml
trace : int -> cmd -> term list
```
such that `trace n c` performs n steps of the small-step semantics
of the command c.

## Implementation details

### Lexer and Parser

You will need two different parser rules to parse commands and expressions.

We suggest starting with expressions: reuse the expression syntax and semantics of [arithexpr](../../expr/arithexpr/README.md) and modify it to fit the new `expr` type. In particular, our new expressions must handle variables, integer constants and comparison operators.

Once you've fully implemented expressions, begin modelling the commands: add the new keywords to the lexer and tell the parser how to parse commands.

The start rule of the parser, which we have always called `prog`, must yield ASTs of type `cmd`.

### Resolving conflicts

You will probably have trouble with precedences.
Menhir warn you of the presence of conflicts like this:
```
Warning: 2 states have shift/reduce conflicts.
Warning: 2 shift/reduce conflicts were arbitrarily resolved.
```
But it doesn't really help that much! It doesn't
tell us which particular tokens are causing the conflicts.
The following command often helps overcome this issue:
```
menhir --explain lib/parser.mly
```
This command will create a file `parser.conflicts` under [lib](lib/). Have a look at it. Here are a few lines of what I get:
```ocaml
** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 39.
** Token involved: SEQ
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

WHILE expr DO cmd

[bla bla...]

** In state 39, looking ahead at SEQ, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

WHILE expr DO cmd 
              cmd . SEQ cmd

[bla bla...]
```
Basically, it's trying to tell us that it doesn't know what to do when parsing a program involving a sequence and a while. Do we put the sequence under the while or vice-versa? For example, the program:
```
while 0 <= x do x := x - 1; skip
```
can mean either:
```
while 0 <= x do (x := x - 1; skip)
```
or:
```
(while 0 <= x do x := x - 1); skip
```

A similar problem arises between if-then-else and sequences.
These conflicts can be solved either by assigning the right precedence to the token for `;` and the tokens for "do" and "else", _or_ simply by adding parentheses to the command syntax.

Since the tests use parentheses, follow the second approach.
